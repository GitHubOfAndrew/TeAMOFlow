# TeAMOFlow - (Tensor And Matrix Operations (with) tensorFlow)

This library is created to quickly deploy matrix-based models using TensorFlow as the computational and programmatic framework. TeAMOFlow stands for "***Te***nsor ***A***nd ***M***atrix ***O***perations (using) Tensor***Flow***". In particular, TeAMOFlow, at its core, is a library meant to facilitate matrix factorization-based recommender systems. 

This project is extremely early in its development cycle and not nearly close to completed. For more information, or if you would like to collaborate, please contact me at andrewjych@gmail.com.
