# TeAMOFlow - (Tensor And Matrix Operations (with) tensorFlow)

This library is created to quickly deploy matrix-based models using TensorFlow as the computational and programmatic framework. TeAMOFlow stands for "**T**ensor **A**nd **M**atrix **O**perations (using) Tensor**Flow**".

This project is extremely early and currently in progress. More information will be given soon.
