        By default, the model will be initialized as a regression-based model using the mean-squared error.

        In general, our models will be of two types:\n
        Regression-based RATING models (i.e. MSE Loss)\n
        Sample-based RANKING models (i.e. WMRB Loss)

        - Regression-based rating models will train to predict the observed interactions, and in the process, obtains user/item embeddings that will guess the correct unobserved interactions. In this way, the model will rate every item per user, and we will take the highest rated items as our recommendations. This configuration is recommended for smaller interaction datasets (~10^5 interactions) as the results are easily interpretable and training runtime is instant.

        - Sample-based ranking models will train to prioritize the highest rated items over lower rated items (i.e. rank the items). This type of model prioritizes the order of items that the user would like more over others, training user/item embeddings to reflect this in the process. This model is recommended for larger datasets (~10^5 + interactions) as it learns to rank items with some idea of "priority" rather than hoping for an accurate rating.
